# odin-recipes
This project displays three different recipes that are macro-friendly and can be used for bodybuiding. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in HTML. So far, I have learned:
 - The basic boilerplate HTML code that each HTML page must contain. That boilerplate was used for every HTML page in this 
project. 

- Multiple header tags, which were used throughout the project,
with each heading in the project getting the appropriate header tag. 
- The paragraph tag, which was used
to add descriptions for the dishes. 
- The unordered list and ordered list tags were used to add ingredients
and procedures to the dishes respectfully. 
- The image tag was used to to add pictures of the finished dishes to the respective dish's page
- The link tag, which was used to add links to the different dish's pages on the main page.

I now know how to make basic HTML pages. I am looking forward to learning more tags and ways to make more complex HTML pages!
